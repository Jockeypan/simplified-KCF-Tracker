# simplified-KCF-Tracker
Codes from joaofaroâ€˜s code and openCV. No longer needs opencv, pretty fast.  
Use it in computing power extremely limited devices.  


Things you need to knew:
1. resizeNN instead of INTER_LINEAR
2. gray image instead of colored image
3. fixed window instead of multiscale trackering

Now you know why it's so fast:-P Easily update it though.
